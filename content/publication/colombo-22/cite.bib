 abstract = {Shape matching is a central problem in geometry processing applications, ranging from texture transfer to statistical shape analysis. The functional maps framework provides a compact representation of correspondences between discrete surfaces, which is then converted into point-wise maps required by real-world applications. The vast majority of methods based on functional maps involve the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LB) as the functional basis. A primary drawback of the LB basis is that its energy does not uniformly cover the surface. This fact gives rise to regions where the estimated correspondences are inaccurate, typically at tiny parts and protrusions. For this reason, state-of-the-art procedures to convert the functional maps (represented in the LB basis) into point-wise correspondences are often error-prone. We propose PCGAU, a new functional basis whose energy spreads on the whole shape more evenly than LB. As such, PC-GAU can replace the LB basis in existing shape matching pipelines. PC-GAU consists of the principal vectors obtained by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to a dictionary of sparse Gaussian functions scattered on the surfaces. Through experimental evaluation of established benchmarks, we show that our basis produces more accurate point-wise maps â€”- compared to LB - when employed in the same shape-matching pipeline.},
