Welcome to the GLADIA research lab! Based in the beautiful city of Rome, we are a dynamic team of computer scientists, physicists, engineers, and mathematicians who are passionate about AI and love to push the boundaries of what is possible, seeking innovative solutions to real-world problems -- or sometimes, making up new ones. We work with images, molecules, graphs, 3D shapes, music, language, games, medical data, and quantum particles. We are always excited to collaborate with other disciplines, bring our expertise to the table and have fun with science!
